							<p>My First Few Weeks of USERDES Class</p>

						<!-- Content -->
							<section id="content">

								<p>Over the past month in USERDES class I started to learn more about user design since I
                                    like projects that are exciting and pleasing in the eye made by me. I had two questions to reflect
                                    my work, thinking process, and even a career in the future. How did USERDES class affected
                                    my idea and how I usually think and what I realized in the past month. I’d like to relay my
                                    thoughts on this paper so that I may find a reason on why my questions are important.
                                    </p>

								<h3>Week 1</h3>

								<p>When the first few activities such as my favorite application and creation of website, I
                                    needed to make this pleasing for me and for the people who will view it. I was conscious of my
                                    work and I wanted to work hard on it as if it could help me in my career and can serve as part of
                                    my portfolio. Every time there are projects that could be related to my course, I'd like to do my
                                    best since these are what will help me once I graduate. To be honest, when I was thinking of my
                                    favorite application, there were social media apps that I could’ve mentioned but I wanted to
                                    show an application that portrays my hobbies. For my website, I wanted it to be simple but
                                    straight-forward just like a resume. Since there is freedom and no right or wrong answers for my
                                    questions, I wanted to be as honest as possible and just say that it wasn’t stressful but comforting
                                    because I am able to do as I please on my work and projects.
                                    </p>

								<h3>Week 2</h3>
								
								<p>I realized in the past month that UI and UX are important topics in my course, anything
                                    with technical work always has a feedback of the customer or user. I also realized that all of us started
                                    out as users, therefore, if we become the people that takes care of the experience of our apps’
                                    users then we should also do some reflection to further develop the relationship of designer and
                                    user.</p>

								<h3>Week 3</h3>

								<p>During the process, I learned that it’s harder for my professor to help us in designing our
                                    own projects since we are on lockdown but instead, she still gives us feedback which is the most
                                    important. I am confident that the students also know that fact and we still try our best.
                                    Nevertheless, we like that on our projects, we have freedom to create however we want.
