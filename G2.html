								<h3>What is Design Thinking?</h3>
								<p>When I think of Design Thinking the first word that comes to mind is process because of
                                    the word thinking. Design, however, is the planning of the structure in where we can solve the
                                    problems that we are facing. With both statements combined, we can say that Design Thinking is
                                    a process of planning the structure to find ways solving a problem. There is a step-by-step
                                    procedure in design thinking where we can make solutions using our creative imagination, but
                                    we want to narrow them down and be specific with each step.
                                    </p>
                                <p>I'd like to add a simple example about the process of Design Thinking. Let’s say we have
                                    a cellular phone; we then discover the need and problem. How can I contact people anywhere
                                    and anytime? The idea is that it works like a telephone booth but mobile and we can carry around
                                    us. The solution would be to create a mobile phone. (Chathurika, 2019)
                                    </p>
                                <h3>Stages in Design Thinking</h3>
                                <p>There are stages in Design Thinking Process that designers follow, Empathizing,
                                    Defining, Ideate, Prototyping and Testing. Let us briefly elaborate each stage and understand
                                    why it is relevant and useful to design thinking.</p>
                                <p>Empathize stage allows us to take our time to understand our users or target audience
                                    about their experience and look at their point of view and have a critical analysis about the
                                    design. Designers would usually ask them why, what and how questions that would narrow their
                                    thoughts and easily point out a solution.</p>
                                <p>Defining stage assumes we already have the problem at hand and the team create plans
                                    and role objectives. This stage is also where we formulate our How Might We problem
                                    statement, where its traits should be: Human-centered, Broad enough for creative freedom, and
                                    Narrow enough to make it manageable. (Chathurika, 2019)
                                    </p>
                                <p>Ideate stage is where the team’s creativity is tested, it is the stage where anyone can think
                                    of any solution in mind. In this stage, it is exciting what kind of innovation or idea could be
                                    imagined, some ideas can even make it to be a solution for an even different problem!</p>
                                <p>Prototyping stage is building the tangible solution and ideas for the users. Designers tend
                                    to do trial and error in this stage and failing is considered as improving.</p>
                                <p>The final stage, testing is where we get feedback from the users. The teams will further
                                    refine until it completely satisfies a solution. But as we know, there will be updates and changes
                                    and it will become an iterative process. Meaning, there are new problems that will arrive as soon
                                    as the testers/users start using the product.</p>
                                <h3>Why is Design Thinking Important?</h3>
                                <p>Why is Design Thinking important? There are multiple ways to answer this question, but
                                    I only have one in mind. People have different types of thoughts, experiences and ideas, that
                                    difference is why we try to collaborate and share with each other, there are times that persons’
                                    idea is more effective than this person. The information that we gather is important for the idea,
                                    much like building a bridge. For knowing how to build a bridge, we need to know how long it
                                    must be or how wide we need it to be, how can it stand? We might need something to support the
                                    bridge for it to not fall. Almost in every aspect in life we gather, process and analyze information
                                    we discover or given to us as if it was our task in life to do so.
