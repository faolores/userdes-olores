								<h3>Week 1 (September 12)</h3>

								<p>On our first week, I chose Aires and Clifford to be my group members, I knew they were
                                    fast thinkers and creative. So, if I remember It was only me and Aires at that time and we tried to
                                    just brainstorm and throw ideas whatever comes to mind for the problem that we are facing right
                                    now, in the middle of discussing that, I liked some of his ideas and so did he. In the end we tried
                                    to focus on problem topics that could be easier for us such as the exercising during pandemic,
                                    earning money, and diet. We chose earning money since it is quite controversial between
                                    students and even people who are at quarantine. After the problem, we tried to have the possible
                                    quotes, pain points and goals on the same day to have progress on the content. I think if I had a
                                    better grasp about the quotes then I couldâ€™ve thought of the content differently but what we made
                                    was similar to mottos.
                                    </p>

								<h3>Week 2 (September 19)</h3>
								
								<p>So, it was our first presentation, and I was kind of in between of being confident and
                                    nervous at the same time since my groupmates had trouble with connection and internet so I had
                                    to present by myself. But I felt good since It was an idea made by my groupmates. I think I did
                                    well on the presentation, but our content lacks a bit, but It was fine since there was always a next
                                    time and I thought to myself, this time we could correct the mistakes and come back with a better
                                    presentation since my team knew what needed to change. I also felt like being a proper leader
                                    since when I ask them to do something, they ask or sometimes I give examples for that sector of
                                    the presentation.
                                    </p>

								<h3>Week 3 (September 26)</h3>

								<p>It was an asynchronous session. but a group was to give feedbacks, comments, or
                                    suggestion to our updated presentation from Week 2. I actually liked being criticized for our
                                    work since it only gives us a chance to make the output better than usual. We also gave our
                                    opinions and what we liked about their presentation and what needed to change and surprisingly
                                    my team and I gave good feedbacks for them and made us felt like we were doing a good job to
                                    help them get better next time.
