                                <h3>Reflection</h3>
								<p>I learned about what information architecture is, I thought it was an architecture plan of data collected, but it was deeper definition than that. So, taxonomy was thought to us and the first thing I thought of was sort of like a library since we take a topic and in try to narrow them down to the specific point same to going to a library, finding a certain book so you try to go to the possible section that it is in and try finding the author of that book. Choreography was introduced soon after and it was quite a simple concept, as if learning a dance and performing it exactly how you practiced which was same to a user repeating on how they use the app when they enter it.
                                    </p>
								
								<p>I pondered why we needed Information Architecture and it was all about organizing, how it pleases the user's eye, how easy it is to keep track of anything important. User-friendly is entirely the word I can compare to information architecture, seeing a website such as Twitter or Facebook made me realize how large of an impact being able to know exactly where things are and unconsciously memorizing them as if I'm in a trance. There were multiple ways on how to arrange your application and they all vary depending on the type of application you were creating and surprisingly, many of them are possible with our group so I was happy and also anxious since we have to get it right and we need to know what the users want our website to be and weâ€™ll try to adjust according to that.</p>
