                                <h3>The General Idea of Design Thinking</h3>
								<p>Design thinking for me was quite amazing, since it involved a group which you will have
                                    to brainstorm and come up with creative ideas individually and having group discussions is
                                    always something I longed for during the pandemic. For me, having my idea picked is
                                    exhilarating, knowing that the course of the project is up to me since it is my idea and also
                                    knowing that my groupmates approve of it as well. When I was learning design thinking, instead
                                    of students, how would those with experience or those who do these types of job everyday think?
                                    It is quite intriguing since those that are professionals are probably fast and know their team very
                                    well. Anyways, Design Thinking for me is like everyday life, discovering problems and the
                                    needs, then coming up with an idea how to do it, it is like finishing tasks in education, but
                                    creatively and is organized.
                                    </p>

								<h3>The Design Thinking Process</h3>

								<p>The design thinking process that I've researched help me realize how organized it is looking
                                    at it from a studentâ€™s perspective. But probably, from an actual designer, there are more than meets
                                    the eye. I find myself sympathizing and analyzing with my works in USERDES, I always tried to
                                    figure out who my audience is when writing or creating, then I try to see it from their perspective
                                    and then think about what else could improve on, then finally, I try to create it and modify it in
                                    according to their feedback.
                                    </p>

								<h3>Why I thought Design Thinking is Important</h3>
								
								<p>So, similar to what I said my work on G2, people have different thoughts, ideas, hardships,
                                    and even experiences. Like how I saw my classmates have different problems on their midterm
                                    presentation, those are what composes of Design Thinking and it is the product of everyone that
                                    made it happen. Yes, there are times when similar ideas come to mind in between individuals but
                                    that is what makes Design Thinking exciting, being on both terms and collaborating to create a
                                    single but strong idea.</p>
