                                <h3>Activity Reflection</h3>
								<p>The activity was to watch the 2 YouTube video links from below. Then play the
                                    succeeding 4 games. Take a screenshot of each screen/score and compile in one document to be
                                    submitted as your A6. It was a simple task and an intriguing one since the activity tell us to play
                                    a game that can help us in our design thinking. For me, I was always ready for those kinds of
                                    activity and I find it interesting as well to test myself on design games.
                                    
                                    </p>
								
								<p>First was to watch the videos, the first video was in-depth but really tells us that we must
                                    make designs clear for people not to misjudge or see it in the wrong way since it may look
                                    incorrect to some. There are consequences with bad graphic design, and it is something that
                                    everyone should be aware of. The second video I thought fonts are always there to make it easier
                                    to read, but typefaces are also used for something for it to describe and make it easier what that
                                    typeface wants us to imagine. Cooper Black was used mostly information and its design is
                                    amusing for most people. I now realize even the slightest curves on the letters of that typeface
                                    would make such a difference and even if it was bold or medium.
                                    </p>

                                <p>Finally, I entered the first game and played it. I was fairly good at the Kerning type and
                                    only a few times I think I made a slight space error on each since a longer letter required me
                                    more focus. It was interesting to see how spaces need to be perfectly matched with each letter
                                    and made me realize that designing words are hard and I applaud to those designers who do this
                                    on the hour.</p>

                                <p>
                                    I then played Brandseen, I was having both a hard time and an OK time with this since
                                    some of them are easy to do. I didnâ€™t know the Apple color background and that part is where I
                                    failed. It is also interesting to see how specific the colors are for each application of logo and it
                                    really is appealing to create that perfect color combo.                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I played Better Web Type which I think was the most hardest game for me. I did not
                                    know how to display the sentences correctly since I really have no idea unlike the other two
                                    which was quite explanatory. I only got a few correct on this game and I think I need to improve
                                    and see how sentences are made with its spacing or how long the sentence should be.                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Lastly, I played the Type War where we had typefaces and had to choose the correct
                                    typeface. I was quite impressed with myself to distinguish the different typefaces and I liked this
                                    game a lot. I think that the game is a good way to introduce designers to typefaces and how they
                                    would look like.
